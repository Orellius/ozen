# Pre-push secret scan. Install it with:
#
#     ln -sf ../../scripts/pre-push-gitleaks.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
#
# WHY A PUSH AND NOT A COMMIT. A commit is local and reversible. A push is the
# moment a secret leaves this machine, and on a PUBLIC repository it is the
# moment it is indexed. Scanning here is the last point where deleting the
# commit is still enough.
#
# WHY FULL HISTORY AND NOT THE DIFF. Making a repository public exposes every
# commit ever made, so a credential removed three months ago is still served by
# the GitHub API. A diff-only scan is the guard that looks in the wrong place
# and is therefore never seen to fire.
#
# FAIL CLOSED, DELIBERATELY. If gitleaks is not installed this refuses the push
# rather than waving it through: a scanner that silently skips is indistinguishable
# from one that found nothing, which is the whole failure mode this exists to stop.
#
# The documented escape hatch, for the case where you have read the finding and
# know it is a fixture:
#
#     git push --no-verify
#
# Do not widen a .gitleaks.toml to make a push succeed. Allowlisting is for values
# that authenticate nothing, one path and one rule at a time, with the reason
# written down.
